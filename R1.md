### Day 2: March 17, Tuesday

**Today's Progress** : Continuing the last code, adding some css and finally finish with reasponsive mobile media query.

**Thoughts**: Sometimes it's a simple just using css on a simple project, however, I think it's better to move to scss due to its nesting style, avoiding confusion, and it's better readablity.
